## Description:
Created for my Year 12 Software Design and Development Assessment 3 Task, Paper Paladin is a 2D turn-based action-adventure RPG game. Through the manipulation of certain keys and cursor movements, within the application users will embark on an epic quest across a vast nonlinear gameworld and combat a diverse array of enemies in intuitive turn-based battle sequences. Users will also able to modify their game settings to their preferences for aspects such as music or sound volume levels, as well as save, load, or delete their respective game save files. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the project's time constraints and lack of existing musical skill respectively, accessibility options for those with visual, motor, or neurological impairments are unfortunately not supported, and public audio libraries and copyrighted media have been used to create the application's in-game soundscape.
