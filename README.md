## Description:
Created for my Year 12 Software Design and Development Assessment 3 Task, Paper Paladin is a 2D turn-based action-adventure RPG game designed to entertain. Through the manipulation of certain arrow and letter keys, within the application users will embark on an epic quest across a vast nonlinear gameworld and combat a diverse array of enemies in intuitive, turn-based battle sequences.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to the project's time constraints and lack of existing musical skill respectively, accessibility options for those with visual, motor, or neurological impairments are unfortunately not supported, and public audio libraries and copyrighted media have been used to create the application's in-game soundscape.

## How to Use:
To interact with the application, certain arrow and letter key inputs are required. The following is included in the application through in-game text prompts and a dedicated "Controls" page in the main menu:
